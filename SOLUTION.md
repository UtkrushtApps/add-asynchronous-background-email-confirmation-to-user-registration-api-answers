# Solution Steps

1. Create a new FastAPI application and import necessary modules: FastAPI, BackgroundTasks, Pydantic models, typing, asyncio, and HTTPException.

2. Define a Pydantic model (UserRegisterRequest) for the incoming registration request with email (EmailStr), password, and full_name fields.

3. Implement a simulated in-memory user database as a Python dictionary (users_db) for demonstration purposes.

4. Write an async function (send_confirmation_email) that simulates sending an email asynchronously (using asyncio.sleep to mimic delay and a print statement to represent the send).

5. In the /register POST endpoint, use dependency injection to get BackgroundTasks.

6. Check if the provided email is already registered; if so, raise an HTTPException with status code 400.

7. Simulate user registration by saving the provided data to the users_db dictionary.

8. To send the confirmation email asynchronously, use background_tasks.add_task to schedule asyncio.create_task(send_confirmation_email(...)), which ensures the email sending coroutine runs in the background.

9. Return a quick JSON response confirming successful registration and instructing the user to check their email.
